## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (Day 1)

#### 1.1 Firebase Project Configuration
```bash
# Initialize Firebase (if not already done)
firebase init

# Configure storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage

# Configure firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

#### 1.2 Environment Variables
Create environment configuration files:

**lib/firebase_options_prod.dart**
```dart
// Production Firebase configuration
class DefaultFirebaseOptions {
  static FirebaseOptions get currentPlatform {
    return const FirebaseOptions(
      apiKey: "your-production-api-key",
      authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "your-production-project",
      storageBucket: "your-production-project.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "123456789",
      appId: "1:123456789:web:abcdef123456",
    );
  }
}
```

#### 1.3 Build Configuration
Update build configurations:

**android/app/build.gradle**
```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        // Add file permissions
        manifestPlaceholders['appName'] = "ChatApp"
    }
}
```

**ios/Runner/Info.plist**
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to take photos</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs photo library access to select images</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs microphone access for voice messages</string>
```

### Phase 2: Backend Deployment (Day 1-2)

#### 2.1 Database Migration
```dart
// Run this script to migrate existing data
class DatabaseMigration {
  static Future<void> migrateToFileSharing() async {
    final firestore = FirebaseFirestore.instance;

    // Add file-related fields to existing messages
    final messages = await firestore.collection('chat_rooms').get();
    for (var chatRoom in messages.docs) {
      final messageDocs = await chatRoom.reference.collection('message').get();
      for (var messageDoc in messageDocs.docs) {
        await messageDoc.reference.update({
          'type': 'text',
          'fileAttachment': null,
          'isEdited': false,
          'editedAt': null,
        });
      }
    }

    // Create files collection index
    await firestore.collection('files').doc('_indexes_').set({
      'created': true,
      'timestamp': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
    });
  }
}
```

#### 2.2 Storage Bucket Setup
```javascript
// Firebase Storage Rules (storage.rules)
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /chat_files/{chatRoomId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid in firestore.get(/databases/(default)/documents/chat_rooms/$(chatRoomId)).data.participants;
      allow write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid in firestore.get(/databases/(default)/documents/chat_rooms/$(chatRoomId)).data.participants &&
        request.resource.size < 50 * 1024 * 1024; // 50MB limit
    }

    match /thumbnails/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2.3 Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
// Firestore Rules (firestore.rules)
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Chat rooms - only participants can read/write
    match /chat_rooms/{chatRoomId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid in resource.data.participants;

      match /messages/{messageId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
          request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/chat_rooms/$(chatRoomId)).data.participants;
      }
    }

    // Files - only chat participants can access
    match /files/{fileId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/chat_rooms/$(resource.data.chatRoomId)).data.participants;
      allow write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.uploadedBy;
    }

    // User files - only owner can access
    match /user_files/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
